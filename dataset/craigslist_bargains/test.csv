I know that without the shiftable gears my kid would either think the pedaling was too hard at times or going so fast they couldn't feel their pedaling helping. It took some time to teach them but definitely the way to go. I highly suggest a shiftable trailer over the non-shifting one.,0.1,0.058823529411764705,4,476,1.0,True,True
