I'm sure there's SOMEONE who could pay $450.","Oh, it's not that I can't pay you $450, but like I said we aren't rich. So we are willing to pay a fair price. Really any material object is only worth 1\/3 of the price of the list, especially after it's been used by any other person. Therefore, technically, and reasonably I could only give you $200 in order for me to not be a foolish capitalist. So, giving you even $420 with good humor is still way too much.
